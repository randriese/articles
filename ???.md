# Title

I've been doing Vue, professionally, for a while now. As usual, whenever I create/setup a new project, I use Vue CLI which abstracts a lot of the heavy weight of creating a new project, which is great, especially if you've ever tried to setup a full Webpack config by yourself.
Nonetheless, I want to walk through the process of setuping a Webpack config by myself and highlight some benefits and drawbacks of using Vue CLI on the way. I will try to mimic as much as possible the behavior of Vue CLI but avoid the usage of its plugins for example.

Why I want to do that? Wel, as sort of documentation/study for myself (I can't remember the last time I went through each Webpack loader and customized it, which is great, don't get me wrong) and also to, maybe, help to people to understand the full process and challenges that comes with such setup (so you might get some feeling about why Vue CLI does a great job for us).

I will try to split it between Webpack, Vue and enhancements. First I will go through Webpack, simple and direct setup, what does it do and so on (the Webpack docs do a great job here). Second I will setup Vue with Wepack, so it can understand `*.vue` files. And finally I will add some things to make our lives easier (hopefully).

## Webpack

Most probably you've heard about Webpack before, if not, check their [official website](https://webpack.js.org) which has tons of documentation about it.

I think this image, from the offical website, summarizes quite well what Webpack does for us:

Once you start reading the documentation you will find out that the first two dependencies you've to install are `webpack` and `webpack-cli`. From here we can start customizing our Webpack config.

The Webpack config starts with the `entry` property, which specifies the entry file to process with Webpack. Once we setup a project with Vue CLI it always points to `main.js` inside the `src/` folder.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  entry: './src/main.js',
};
```

If we add any Javascript code to `main.js` it will get processed by Webpack and the output will be placed inside `dist/` folder. To run Webpack we just need to `npx webpack --config webpack.config.js`.

First thing it complains (warns) is regarding the `mode` property which was not set.

From Webpack docs:
> Providing the `mode` configuration option tells webpack to use its built-in optimizations accordingly.

It can be `production`, `development` or `none`.

A good start now is to setup NPM scripts with our build steps, so we can build our project for production, development, or something else.

```json
"scripts": {
  "build:production": "webpack --config webpack.config.js --mode=production",
  "build:development": "webpack --config webpack.config.js --mode=development"
}
```

So far we can add Javascript code to `src/main.js` file and build it. Not that useful, but it is the basic setup.

**Next step: Setup output and Babel to transpile code**
